			<h2>Section 1 Part 1:</h2>
				<h3>Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.</h3>
					<p>
						De Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive algorithm meant to evaluate Bezier curves. It takes as input an initial
						set of control points and a parameter t that decides how to interpolate along the control points.  In the first 
						iteration, the algorithm calculates intermediate points along the edges between the control points (distance
						based on t), then connects these 2 intermediate points. We use the newly created polygon as the next points
						to recurse on. This process repeats until the algorithm has reached a single point or if the curve is smooth.
					</p>
				<h3>Take a look at the provided .bzc files and create your own Bezier curve with 6 control points of your choosing. 
					Use this Bezier curve for your screenshots below.</h3>
				<h3>Show screenshots of each step / level of the evaluation from the original control points down to the final evaluated
					 point. Press E to step through. Toggle C to show the completed Bezier curve as well.</h3>

			<h2>Section 1 Part 2:</h2>
				<h3>Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to 
					evaluate Bezier surfaces.</h3>
					<p>
						The de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces very easily because we just need to deal with an extra
						dimension (Bezier surfaces are defined by 2D control points array). Given an nxn grid of control points, we 
						first ran the de Casteljau algorithm row-wise, in order to create a 1D N-length array of control points Pi.
						Finally, we ran the de Casteljau algorithm one more time (visualized vertically) on these Pi values to 
						evaluate the Bezier surface.

			<h2>Section 2 Part 3:</h2>
				<h3>Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.</h3>
					<p>
						In order to implement the area-weighted vertex normals, we first referenced Lecture 6 slides on shading triangle
						meshes and the Blinn-Phong Reflection model. We knew that for each vertex, the shade would be an area-weighted vertex
						normal of the surrounding faces. Thus, we also referenced the Half-edge data structure from Discussion 4, specifically
						the exercise of traversing the mesh using the half edges. For each surrounding face of the vertex, we stored its area
						as well as its normal vector. Then, we calculated the area-weighted normals, and averaged those to return the final
						unit normal for that vertex.

			<h2>Section 2 Part 4:</h2>
				<h3>Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation /
					 debugging tricks you have used.</h3>
					 <p>
						In order to implement the edge flip operation, the main point of logic was ensuring that all of the mesh
						element pointers remained correct. We first set temporary variables storing the old center edges, 
						4 half edges, 4 vertices, and 2 faces. Then, we reassigned the realigned vertices, edges, faces, and Finally
						the half edges using the SetNeighbors function provided. 
						While we don't believe we had any unique or particularly interesting implementation tricks, drawing out 
						visuals of the before and after flipping diagrams, and physical pointers to each location was extremely
						helpful in the implementation.

				<h3>Show screenshots of the teapot before and after some edge flips.</h3>

				<h3>Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.</h3>
					 <p>
						We used the <b>check_for(...)</b> debugging function to check what elements are getting pointed. We also used
						many print statements line-by-line to check for what specific lines were segfaultin.
					 </p>
			<h2>Section 2 Part 5:</h2>
				<h3>Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / 
					debugging tricks you have used.</h3>
					<p>
						Similarily to implementing edge flipping, edge splitting was also all about keeping track of 
						pointers and mesh elements. First, we extracted all of the mesh info into temporary variables, 
						such as creating HalfedgeIter center = e0->halfedge() and HalfedgeIter centerTwin = center->twin().
						Then, we created the new mesh elements, which were the new edges and new vertex with position calculated
						from the average of the vertical vertices (B and C). Then, we went about creating the new faces and half
						edge elements, and then assigning the correct pointers in vertices, half edges to edges, and half edges
						to faces. Finally, we updated the half edges using the setNeighbors function provided, going about 
						a similar process of diligently following 2 visuals of the before and after mesh elements.

			<h2>Section 2 Part 6:</h2>
				<h3>Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / 
					debugging tricks you have used.</h3>
					<p>
						Our approach mostly followed the ordered steps given in the spec. First, we looped through every single
						vertex in the mesh and calculated the updated position of it based on the equation using n (vertex degree),
						u (constant based on n), and original position of the vertex. We stored that new position in the 
						newPosition field for the vertex, and set the flag to isNew == false. Then, we split every edge. 
						And, we iterated over every edge in
						the mesh, storing that new position using the equation: 3/8 * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C + D). 
						 This required using the HalfEdge interface provided. 
						 Next, we iterated over each edge again: If that edge connected an old vertex and a new vertex in the mesh, 
						 then we would flip it. (1 blue and 1 brown edge example in the lecture slides).
						 Finally, we copied those new positions for vertices into the final Vertex::position.
						 While there weren't any unique debugging tricks we tried, we utilized help from staff and lecture slides
						 each step of the way, trying to visualize the problem using the provided diagrams.
					</p>
				<h3>Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. 
					What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?</h3>
					<p>
						Sharp corners and edges become more smooth and rounded after loop subdivision. Also, the length of edges
						becomes reduced as we are inserting new vertices in the midpoint of edges. In the overall shape, sharper corners
						and edges become more smoothed out the more subdivides we do. However, if you preprocess the cube/shape 
						by splitting and flipping an edge to create an obvious indent in the shape, that indent remains preserved
						over subdivides. By pre-splitting edges, we can somewhat guide the sharpness of the subdivided shape.

				<h3>Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube 
					becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips
					 and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. 
					 Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.</h3>
					<p>
						Yes, you can pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically.
						In our case, we split every single face, so that there's an "X" on every single face of the cube before
						loop subdividing. The asymmetry can occur because in the subdivision process, the weights used are not always
						perfectly symmetric. When we use the equation <b>(1 - n * u) * original_position + u * original_neighbor_position_sum</b>
						to update the position of an old vertex, the constants for n and u change based on the vertex degree. We noticed
						that the same vertex for multiple iterations changed from degree 3->6->5, signifying no symmetry. Thus, When
						we determine the position of a new vertex based on the neighboring vertices, the weights may not be the same, so we 
						get asymmetric stretching in different directions. 

						Pre-processing helps alleviate these effects because we can ensure that each vertex is connected along the same
						number of edges to start (essentialy making an X on each face), so that the future weighting is distributed the same, 
						and we get symmetric subdivision in future iterations.
