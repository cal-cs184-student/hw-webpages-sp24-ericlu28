		<h1>Homework 1 Writeup</h1>
		<h2>Task 1: </h2>
		<h3>Walk through how you rasterize triangles in your own words.</h3>
			<p>
			We are rasterizing triangles by sampling pixel centers that are contained inside of the edges of the triangle, which we check with a helper function, <b>contained_in_triangle</b>. 
			Then, we iterate over every single pixel (double for loop for each x in the width and y in the height) and checking this condition. If the pixel center is contained within the triangle, 
			then we sample that color and include it into our buffer. Otherwise, we move on.
			</p>
		<h3>Explain how your algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle.</h3>
			<p>
				This algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle because we are iterating over each pixel within the bounding box, and 
				checking if this pixel is within the triangle. We are iterating over width * height number of pixels, which is no less than each sample within the bounding box.
			</p>
		<h3>Show a png screenshot of basic/test4.svg with the default viewing parameters and with the pixel inspector centered on an interesting part of the scene.</h3>

		<h2>Task 2: </h2>
		<h3>Walk through your supersampling algorithm and data structures. Why is supersampling useful? What modifications did you 
			make to the rasterization pipeline in the process? Explain how you used supersampling to antialias your triangles.</h3>
			<p>

			</p>
		<h3>Show png screenshots of basic/test4.svg with the default viewing parameters and sample rates 1, 4, and 16 to compare them 
			side-by-side. Position the pixel inspector over an area that showcases the effect dramatically; for example, a very skinny triangle corner. 
			Explain why these results are observed.</h3>
			<p>

			</p>
		<h2>Task 3: </h2>
			<h3>
				Create an updated version of svg/transforms/robot.svg with cubeman doing something more interesting, like waving 
				or running. Feel free to change his colors or proportions to suit your creativity. Save your svg file as my_robot.svg 
				in your docs/ directory and show a png screenshot of your rendered drawing in your write-up. 
				Explain what you were trying to do with cubeman in words.
			</h3>
		<h2>Task 4: </h2>
			<h3>
				Explain barycentric coordinates in your own words and use an image to aid you in your explanation. One idea is to use 
				a svg file that plots a single triangle with one red, one green, and one blue vertex, which should produce a smoothly 
				blended color triangle.
			</h3>
			<p>

			</p>
			<h3>Show a png screenshot of svg/basic/test7.svg with default viewing parameters and sample rate 1. If you make any 
				additional images with color gradients, include them.
			</h3>
			<p>
