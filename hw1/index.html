		<h1>Homework 1 Writeup</h1>
		<h2>Overview: </h2>
			<p>

			</p>
		<h2>Task 1: </h2>
		<h3>Walk through how you rasterize triangles in your own words.</h3>
			<p>
			We are rasterizing triangles by sampling pixel centers that are contained inside of the edges of the triangle, which we check with a helper function, <b>contained_in_triangle</b>. 
			Then, we iterate over every single pixel (double for loop for each x in the width and y in the height) and checking this condition. If the pixel center is contained within the triangle, 
			then we sample that color and include it into our buffer. Otherwise, we move on.
			</p>
		<h3>Explain how your algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle.</h3>
			<p>
				This algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle because we are iterating over each pixel within the bounding box, and 
				checking if this pixel is within the triangle. We are iterating over width * height number of pixels, which is no less than each sample within the bounding box.

		<h2>Task 2: </h2>
		<h3>Walk through your supersampling algorithm and data structures. Why is supersampling useful? What modifications did you 
			make to the rasterization pipeline in the process? Explain how you used supersampling to antialias your triangles.</h3>
			<p>
				<p>
					In the supersampling algorithm, our frame gets scaled by up sqrt(sample rate) in both dimensions. As a result,
					we upscale the vertices of the triangles passed in. With these new larger triangles, we perform the same line test as in 
					the previous part. When we resolve the frame buffer, we iterate throuhg the sample buffer in sqrt(sample rate) * sqrt(sample rate)
					squares and collapse each into a single pixel: we do this by collapsing by averaging the color values across the square.
				</p>
				<p>
					Supersampling is useful because it allows you to sample at a higher resoltuion and average the values in your buffer to
					encapsulate more of what's going on within a single pixel. This creates a bluffering effect that reduces the jagged
					edges that we get because of aliasing.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the rasterization pipeline, we upscale our triangles by the square root of the samle rate. Then, when resolving to 
					the frame buffer, we average each sub grid so that the resolution matches our device specification.
				</p>
			</p>
		<h3>Show png screenshots of basic/test4.svg with the default viewing parameters and sample rates 1, 4, and 16 to compare them 
			side-by-side. Position the pixel inspector over an area that showcases the effect dramatically; for example, a very skinny triangle corner. 
			Explain why these results are observed.</h3>

				<img src="./task2-4.png" alt="Task 2-16 screenshot" width="800" height="600">

				We are seeing these results because of the change in sample rate. 
				For the low sample rate(1 sample per pixel), the color of the sample is determined by the color of one pixel.
				This is why we see the most dramatic color changes from pink to white.
				For the medium sample rate (4 samples per pixel), we are taking the average of the variations in color for that pixel, which results
				in a smoother image transition from pink to lighter pink to white.
				The highest sample rate (16 samples per pixel) has the most refined image and averaged colors, leading to the most reduced aliasing.

		<h2>Task 3: </h2>
			<h3>
				Create an updated version of svg/transforms/robot.svg with cubeman doing something more interesting, like waving 
				or running. Feel free to change his colors or proportions to suit your creativity. Save your svg file as my_robot.svg 
				in your docs/ directory and show a png screenshot of your rendered drawing in your write-up. 
				Explain what you were trying to do with cubeman in words.

					We tried making the cubeman wave with both hands, as well as changed the head of cubeman to be black.

		<h2>Task 4: </h2>
			<h3>
				Explain barycentric coordinates in your own words and use an image to aid you in your explanation. One idea is to use 
				a svg file that plots a single triangle with one red, one green, and one blue vertex, which should produce a smoothly 
				blended color triangle.
			</h3>
			<p>
				Barycentric coordinates give us a way to position a point's location within a triangle in relation to the triangle's 
				vertices. Each barycentric coordinate represents one vertex of a triangle, with the numbers weighted by the proportion of
				each vertex that is contributing to the triangle. As we can see in the picture below, different points in the triangle 
				are colored based on their location in relation to the 3 vertices. Points closer to the left are more blue, points closer to the 
				top right are more red, and points closer to the bottom right are more green. Points in between are a mix of these colors, with
				heavier weight to points closer to the corresonding vertex color.

				additional images with color gradients, include them.

		<h2>Task 5: </h2>
			<h3>
				Explain pixel sampling in your own words and describe how you implemented it to perform texture mapping. 
				Briefly discuss the two different pixel sampling methods, nearest and bilinear.
			</h3>
			<p>
				Pixel sampling is figuring out what color a pixel should be in an image based on looking at its location. 
				We did it in two ways to implement texture mapping: nearest sampling and bilinear sampling. In nearest sampling, 
				the nearest pixel was directly sampled to assign color for the pixel location. In bilinear sampling, we interpolate between 
				the four nearest pixels where the interpolation is based on the distances between the target pixel and the 4 neighboring pixels. 
			</p>
			<h3>
				Check out the svg files in the svg/texmap/ directory. Use the pixel inspector to find a good example of where 
				bilinear sampling clearly defeats nearest sampling. Show and compare four png screenshots using nearest sampling 
				at 1 sample per pixel, nearest sampling at 16 samples per pixel, bilinear sampling at 1 sample per pixel, 
				and bilinear sampling at 16 samples per pixel.
			</h3>
			<p>
				Bilinear sampling often outperforms nearest sampling in scenarios where we want smooth gradient transitions. I looked
				for a location where there were multiple colors adjacent to one another, for example from blue to light blue to dark 
				green to green. These are the pictures:
			</p>
			<p>
				Nearest sampling (1 sample per pixel)
				<img src="./task5-n1.png" alt="Task 5 screenshot 1" width="800" height="600">
			</p>
			<p>
				Nearest sampling (16 samples per pixel)
				<img src="./task5-n16.png" alt="Task 5 screenshot 2" width="800" height="600">
			</p>
			<p>
				Bilinear sampling (1 sample per pixel)
				<img src="./task5-b1.png" alt="Task 5 screenshot 3" width="800" height="600">
			</p>
			<p>
				Bilinear sampling (16 samples per pixel)
				<img src="./task5-b16.png" alt="Task 5 screenshot 4" width="800" height="600">
			</p>
			<h3>
				Comment on the relative differences. Discuss when there will be a large difference between the two methods and why.
			</h3>
			<p>
				Bilinear sampling often outperforms nearest sampling in scenarios where we want smooth gradient transitions. 
				We see the largest difference between the two methods in zooming in on locations where 1 pixel is a drastically different
				color from the surrounding pixels. For example, in the nearest sampling rate 1 per pixel, there is locations with 
				a single black pixel among blue and a single yellow pixel among green. We won't see this in bilinear sampling rate 1 per pixel
				, where that pixel is averaged (more blue or more green looking). Rather than being a black pixel among blue pixels, it's 
				a lighter grey pixel that has weight from the blue contributing to it. 
				In general, the bilinear sampling has smoother color gradient transitions than nearest pixel sampling. 
			</p>
		<h2>Task 6: </h2>
			<h3>
				Explain level sampling in your own words and describe how you implemented it for texture mapping.
			</h3>
			<p>

			</p>
			<h3>
				You can now adjust your sampling technique by selecting pixel sampling, level sampling, or the number of samples 
				per pixel. Describe the tradeoffs between speed, memory usage, and antialiasing power between the three various 
				techniques.
			</h3>
			<p>

			</p>
			<h3>
				Using a png file you find yourself, show us four versions of the image, using the combinations of L_ZERO and P_NEAREST, 
				L_ZERO and P_LINEAR, L_NEAREST and P_NEAREST, as well as L_NEAREST and P_LINEAR.
