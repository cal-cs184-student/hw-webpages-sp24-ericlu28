			<h2>Overview: </h2>
				<p>

				</p>
			<h2>Section 1 Part 1:</h2>
				<h3>Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.</h3>
					<p>
						De Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive algorithm meant to evaluate Bezier curves. It takes as input an initial
						set of control points and a parameter t that decides how to interpolate along the control points.  In the first 
						iteration, the algorithm calculates intermediate points along the edges between the control points (distance
						based on t), then connects these 2 intermediate points. We use the newly created polygon as the next points
						to recurse on. This process repeats until the algorithm has reached a single point or if the curve is smooth.
					</p>
			<h2>Section 1 Part 2:</h2>
				<h3>Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to 
					evaluate Bezier surfaces.</h3>
					<p>
						The de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces very easily because we just need to deal with an extra
						dimension (Bezier surfaces are defined by 2D control points array). Given an nxn grid of control points, we 
						first ran the de Casteljau algorithm row-wise, in order to create a 1D N-length array of control points Pi.
						Finally, we ran the de Casteljau algorithm one more time (visualized vertically) on these Pi values to 
						evaluate the Bezier surface.
