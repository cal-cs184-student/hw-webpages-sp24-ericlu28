			<h2>Project Overview: </h2>

			<h2>Part 1: </h2>
				<h3>Take some screenshots of scene/pinned2.json from a viewing angle where you can clearly see the cloth 
					wireframe to show the structure of your point masses and springs.</h3>

				<h3>Show us what the wireframe looks like (1) without any shearing constraints, 
					(2) with only shearing constraints, and (3) with all constraints.</h3>

			<h2> Part 2: </h2>
				<h3>Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation. To do so, pause the simulation at the start with P, 
					modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing P again. 
					You can also restart the simulation at any time from the cloth's starting position by pressing R.</h3>
				<h3>Describe the effects of changing the spring constant ks; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a 
					very low ks? A high ks?</h3>
					<p>Changing the the spring constant ks changes both the tension by which the cloth hangs from the pins, 
						as well as the speed at which the cloth falls during the simulation. From a resting position with a very low ks,
						such as experimented values like 1 N/m and 100 N/m, the cloth is much more compressed on the left and right
						sides, and also hangs lower at the top, signifying more effects of gravity pushing down because of the lower
						tension from the pins. From a resting position with a high ks value, such as experimented values like 10000 N/m, the 
						cloth has almost no compression from the left and right sides, as well as minimal fold at the top. At 
						100000 N/m, it essentially looks like the cloth is laying flat on the ground stretched out, as the tension 
						from the springs is completely stretching out the cloth.
					</p>
				<h3>What about for density?</h3>
					<p>Changing the density of the cloth also changes how much compression and stretching it experiences. 
						With lower cloth density values, we see the cloth experiencing less downwards stretch at the top folding over,
						as well as less compression from the left and right sides. With higher density values, the cloth is hanging "heavier"
						on the pins, so there is more downward pull from gravity, as well as more compression from the left and right sides
						towards the center of the cloth.
					</p>
				<h3>What about for damping?</h3>
					<p>
						Damping affects the speed and motion at which the cloth gets from start to finish of the simulation. At low percentage 
						damping values, the cloth falls rapidly, and sways back-and-forth in motion, as its very light and affected by 
						forces. Thusk, it takes a while for the cloth to reach a steady state. Also, the non-pinned corners
						of the cloth flap inwards back-and-forth at ease. At high percentage damping values, the cloth falls very slowly, and 
						almost immediately reaches steady state; there is no flapping back-and-forth occuring because the cloth is much heavier in motion and 
						unaffected.

					</p>
				<h3>For each of the above, observe any noticeable differences in the cloth compared to the default parameters 
					and show us some screenshots of those interesting differences and describe when they occur.</h3>
					<p>
						Default: <img src="./p2-default.png" alt="cbspheres" width="600" height="450">
					</p>
					<p>
						Low ks spring value: The cloth hangs much  lower at the immediate resting state.
						<img src="./p2-low-ks.png" alt="cbspheres" width="600" height="450">
					</p>
					<p>
						High ks spring value: The cloth hangs much higher and tense at the resting state.
						<img src="./p2-high-ks.png" alt="cbspheres" width="600" height="450">
					</p>
					<p>
						Low density value: The cloth has very little compression hanging off of the pins at the resting state
						because it has so little density to weigh it down. Also, it falls quicker from starting resting position
						to final resting position.
						<img src="./p2-low-density.png" alt="cbspheres" width="600" height="450">
					</p>
					<p>
						High density value: The cloth hangs much lower at the resting state because 
						it is more dense, and also takes a longer time
						during the simulation to fall, as the fall is more exaggerated/elongated
						<img src="./p2-high-density.png" alt="cbspheres" width="600" height="450">
					</p>
					<p>
						Low damping percentage: At all times from the start to end resting state, the cloth flops around
						aggressively and loosely, swinging back and forth many times before reaching resting state. 
						It takes much longer for the cloth to reach steady state than the default parameters, but that is not because
						it falls slower Ths is because it is going past the location of resting state, and swining back and forth 
						over that location sinusoidally.

						Here are some images of the swinging back and forth process.
						<b>Swinging there: </b>
						<img src="./p2-low-damping-there1.png" alt="cbspheres" width="600" height="450">
						<img src="./p2-low-damping-there2.png" alt="cbspheres" width="600" height="450">
						<b>Middle: </b>
						<img src="./p2-low-damping-mid.png" alt="cbspheres" width="600" height="450">
						<b> Swinging back: </b>

						<img src="./p2-low-damping-back2.png" alt="cbspheres" width="600" height="450">
					</p>
					<p>
						High damping percentage: From the start to end resting state, the cloth falls downwards in one predictable
						motion, not swinging back and forth at all. It reaches the resting state slower than the default parameters,
						and that is because it is falling slower. 
						<b>Start:</b><img src="./p2-high-damping-1.png" alt="cbspheres" width="600" height="450">
						<b>Middle:</b><img src="./p2-high-damping-2.png" alt="cbspheres" width="600" height="450">
						<b>Ending:</b><img src="./p2-high-damping-3.png" alt="cbspheres" width="600" height="450">

				<h3>Show us a screenshot of your shaded cloth from scene/pinned4.json in its final resting state! 
					If you choose to use different parameters than the default ones, please list them.</h3>
					<p>

			<h2> Part 3: </h2>
				<h3>Show us screenshots of your shaded cloth from scene/sphere.json in its final resting state on the sphere 
					using the default ks = 5000 as well as with ks = 500 and ks = 50000. Describe the differences in the results.</h3>
					<p>
						<b>Default ks shaded cloth:</b>
						<img src="./p3-default-ks.png" alt="cbspheres" width="600" height="450">
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Low ks shaded cloth:</b>
						<img src="./p3-low-ks.png" alt="cbspheres" width="600" height="450">
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>High ks shaded cloth:</b>
						<img src="./p3-high-ks.png" alt="cbspheres" width="600" height="450">
					</p>
					<p>
						The major differences in the shaded cloth on the sphere for the different ks values is the looseness in 
						orientation that the cloth is draped over the sphere. In the lowest ks cloth, the cloth is draped most loosely 
						over the cloth, and we can see that the ridges in the cloth barely point outwards, as they're being directed
						draping downwards. In the highest ks cloth, the cloth is hardly draped tightly over the top of the sphere, and then 
						the rest of the cloth pushes outwards, rather than draping down. The default ks shaded cloth is in-between, with 
						much less outwards push, but some downwards draping.

				<h3>Show us a screenshot of your shaded cloth lying peacefully at rest on the plane. 
					If you haven't by now, feel free to express your colorful creativity with the cloth! 
					(You will need to complete the shaders portion first to show custom colors.)</h3>

			<h2> Part 4: </h2>
				<h3>Show us at least 3 screenshots that document how your cloth falls and folds on itself, 
					starting with an early, initial self-collision and ending with the cloth at a more restful state 
					(even if it is still slightly bouncy on the ground).</h3>

				<h3>Vary the density as well as ks and describe with words and screenshots how they affect the behavior of 
					the cloth as it falls on itself.</h3>
			<h2> Part 5: </h2>
				<h3>Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together 
					to create lighting and material effects.</h3>
				<h3>Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader 
					outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, 
					a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.</h3>
				<h3>Show a screenshot of your texture mapping shader using your own custom texture by modifying the textures in 
					/textures/.</h3>
				<h3>Show a screenshot of bump mapping on the cloth and on the sphere. Show a screenshot of displacement mapping 
					on the sphere. Use the same texture for both renders. You can either provide your own texture or use one of 
					the ones in the textures directory, BUT choose one that's not the default texture_2.png. 
					Compare the two approaches and resulting renders in your own words. Compare how your the two shaders 
					react to the sphere by changing the sphere mesh's coarseness by using -o 16 -a 16 and then -o 128 -a 128.</h3>
				<h3>Show a screenshot of your mirror shader on the cloth and on the sphere.</h3>
				<h3>Explain what you did in your custom shader, if you made one.</h3>
